# Introducing Chaos Fortress: TF2 with custom classes!
***Chaos Fortress*** is a game mode inspired by one of my previous developer ventures: **Boss VS Boss**. It was an old, private game mode, centered around **[the highly talented Batfoxkid's _FF2 Rewrite_](https://github.com/Batfoxkid/Freak-Fortress-2-Rewrite)**, in which every player was a Freak Fortress boss. In addition to being every bit as insane as it sounds, most of the bosses in BvB could get VERY complex, which made the game mode nightmarishly unfriendly to beginners. This, in addition to many other issues such as lag and a plethora of bugs, eventually drove me to take the concept a step further and turn it into something more akin to a modern class-based shooter. And so, ***Chaos Fortress*** was born!

## Installation Guide:
  1. Install all of the prerequisites (see below).
  2. Download the latest release. (LINK PENDING)
  3. Extract the zip file directly to your server's sourcemod folder.
  4. ***Chaos Fortress*** should now be installed on your server!
  5. Configure the game mode to your heart's content. *(Optional)* 

## Prerequisites:
- [SourceMod 1.11+](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php)
- [TF2Attributes 1.7.0+](https://github.com/FlaminSarge/tf2attributes)
- [TF2Items](https://github.com/asherkin/TF2Items)

## Making Custom Characters
***Chaos Fortress*** comes with a number of pre-made custom characters, but what if that's not enough? What if you want *more*? Don't worry, because Chaos Fortress has you covered: ***if you know how to make a Freak Fortress boss, you'll know how to make a Chaos Fortress character!*** And even if you don't, don't worry; it's not very difficult to figure out if you're experienced with SourceMod development. Most of my experience as a SourceMod developer comes from making Freak Fortress bosses, and I knew most of the developers who might take an interest in this game mode would be similar, so I was very careful to keep the development process for ***Chaos Fortress*** characters as close to that of ***Freak Fortress*** characters as possible.
  - **Look at [FILE PENDING] to see an example of a *Chaos Fortress* character CFG.**
  - **Look at [FILE PENDING] to see an example of a *Chaos Fortress* character plugin.**
  - **Please note that FF2 plugins and configs will *not* work for *Chaos Fortress* characters.**
  - **I *HIGHLY* recommend you refer to the *Developer Forwards and Natives (WIKI PAGE PENDING)* wiki page and follow its guidance if you intend to write character plugins.
    - Ignoring this wiki page will not break ***Chaos Fortress***, but it will result in unorganized plugins and may result in awkward issues stemming from plugin run order. ***Ignore at your own peril!***

## Configuring Active Characters and Packs
Let's say you want to add or remove a character, or you have a handful of characters you want to be able to activate or deactivate on demand. This is exactly what the character pack system is for.
  - **Look at [characters.cfg](addons/sourcemod/data/chaos_fortress/characters.cfg) for an example.**
  - **All characters must be located in addons/sourcemod/configs/chaos_fortress.**
      - **Sub-directories *are* allowed.**
   
## Game Mode Configuration Options
All configurable options specific to this game mode can be controlled in [game_rules.cfg](addons/sourcemod/data/chaos_fortress/game_rules.cfg).
