# Introducing Chaos Fortress: TF2 with custom classes!
***Chaos Fortress*** is a game mode inspired by one of my previous developer ventures: **Boss VS Boss**. It was an old, private game mode, centered around **[the highly talented Batfoxkid's _FF2 Rewrite_](https://github.com/Batfoxkid/Freak-Fortress-2-Rewrite)**, in which every player was a Freak Fortress boss. In addition to being every bit as insane as it sounds, most of the bosses in BvB could get VERY complex, which made the game mode nightmarishly unfriendly to beginners. This, in addition to many other issues such as lag and a plethora of bugs, eventually drove me to take the concept a step further and turn it into something more akin to a modern class-based shooter. And so, ***Chaos Fortress*** was born!

## Custom Characters
***Chaos Fortress*** comes with a number of pre-made custom characters, but what if that's not enough? What if you want *more*? Don't worry, because Chaos Fortress has you covered: ***if you know how to make a Freak Fortress boss, you'll know how to make a Chaos Fortress character!*** Most of my experience as a SourceMod developer comes from making Freak Fortress bosses, and I knew most of the developers who might take an interest in this game mode would be similar, so I was very careful to keep the development process for ***Chaos Fortress*** characters as close to that of ***Freak Fortress*** characters as possible.
