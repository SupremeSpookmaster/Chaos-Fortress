//#define TESTING
//
//	- IMMEDIATE PLANS:
//		- Spookmaster Bones:
//			- Make him quieter.
//		- Orbital Sniper:
//			- Make custom sounds and implement them. Remove the DSP effect attribute once this is done.
//		- Count Heavnich:
//			- Optional: properly implement mega deflector weapon sounds.
//		- Demopan:
//			- Make Ultimate Ability, "GLOBAL TRADE".
//			- Make various improvements to CF_CreateShieldWall:
//				- Figure out how to let allies shoot bullets through it, currently it blocks ALL hitscan not just enemies.
//				- Figure out a way to let custom damage sources deal damage to shields.
//				- Include shields in the generic AOE native.
//				- Include shields in the default trace.
//			- Tinker with shield charge attributes.
//		- Future Development:
//			- Look into using the m_afButtonForced property.
//
//	- BALANCE CHANGES (things to keep in mind for balancing)
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Mercenary:
//			- None! (Pending public opinion during beta)
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Spookmaster Bones:
//			- Required ult charge is definitely too low, skeletons spawned by ult kills allow ults to snowball into each other.
//			- Any kill will grant a soul, not just melee. This encourages sitting at a distance and fishing for souls risk-free with Skull Servants instead of getting in and fighting.
//				- Make players drop timed soul pickups that the SB player needs to manually pick up to gain the soul. Upon being picked up, these souls immediately heal the user for 75 HP.
//					- This is a fairly drastic change. Only do this if people think SB is overpowered.
//					- Thanks to all of the work we just put into fake health kits, this should be super easy to implement!
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Orbital Sniper:
//			- There's not a lot of viable counterplay against an Orbital hugging the skybox, besides having another Orbital counter-snipe them.
//				- This will be solved with future characters who also have decent ranged choices.
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Count Heavnich:
//			- "Chow Down" might be too strong compared to "Share Sandvich", resulting in players never using Share.
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Demopan:
//			- Using Profit Blast to blast jump *might* give him too much mobility for a tank.
//
//	- MANDATORY TO-DO LIST (these MUST be done before the initial release):
//	- TODO: Everything that happens on client disconnect (possibly already covered, not sure).
//	- TODO: Check includes to see if I will need to add anything to the prerequisites section of the readme before launch.
//	- TODO: Finalize the wiki by updating each page with all of the changes.
//	- TODO: Add support for translations. This will be a huge pain in the ass, but does not need to be done until public release.
//
//	- OPTIONAL TO-DO LIST (these do not need to be done for the initial release, but would be nice future additions):
//	- Separate the "description" section of "menu_display" into "desc_brief" and "desc_detailed".
//	- Make natives which share the names of FF2's natives and do the same things, so porting FF2 plugins is as simple as just changing the include file and recompiling.
//
//	- MINOR BUGS (bugs which have no impact on gameplay and just sort of look bad):
//	- For some reason, players get equipped with the heavy's Apparatchik's Apparel cosmetic????????????????????????? It's invisible while alive but becomes visible on death. This has no effect on gameplay but it's really ugly. Honestly baffling.
//			- This may have fixed itself, I never see the Apparatchik's Apparel anymore.
//	- Certain hats, when equipped via the wearable system, usually do not visually appear on bots (but they do work *sometimes*). Count Heavnich's "Noble Amassment of Hats" is an example of such a hat. 
//	- COUNT HEAVNICH: I don't know how, but "Chow Down" *sometimes* still causes you to T-pose when it ends. This is fixed immediately by switching weapons, and has no permanent side effects. It does look very unprofessional, though, so I am inclined to find a fix if possible.
//
//	- MAJOR BUGS (bugs which impact gameplay or character creation in any significant way):
//	- DEVELOPMENT: The "preserve" variable of cf_generic_wearable does not work. This may actually not be possible without an enormous workaround due to interference from TF2's source code, I am not sure.
//			- Scrap this feature entirely and remove all mentions of it from the code. This will be a giant pain in the ass but does not need to be done until public release.
//	- SPOOKMASTER BONES: Dialogue is too loud and can be heard from nearly anywhere on the map, make a cf_soundpack ability to make all of them quieter.
//			- Not really a bug, but still sloppy work that I would like to *not* have present on release.
//	- ALL: The default trace gets blocked by invisible clips like spawn doors and such. Filter them out.
//	- ALL: Clipless weapons (sniper rifle, minigun, flamethrower) can pick up ammo from dispensers/the payload, but do not actually replenish ammo upon doing so, and cannot pick up ammo packs. This will make characters like Heavnich useless, so it MUST be fixed before the open beta.
//			- Try messing around with the max ammo/clip size attributes.
//	- DEVELOPMENT: The change to the wearables system which fixed demo shields not having a charge meter also broke cosmetic styles.
//	- DEVELOPMENT: Using the "precache" section of the character config for model precaches will cause that character to not load, and will break the !characters menu.
