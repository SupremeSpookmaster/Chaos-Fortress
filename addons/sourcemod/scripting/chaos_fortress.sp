//
//	- IMMEDIATE PLANS:
//		- Orbital Sniper:
//			- Make custom sounds and implement them. Remove the DSP effect attribute once this is done.
//		- Demopan:
//			- Figure out a way to let custom damage sources deal damage to shields.
//			- Include shields in the generic AOE native.
//			- Include shields in the default trace.
//			- Tinker with shield charge attributes.
//		- Future Development:
//			- Look into using the m_afButtonForced property.
//
//	- BALANCE CHANGES (things to keep in mind for balancing)
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Mercenary:
//			- None! (Pending public opinion during beta)
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Spookmaster Bones:
//			- Any kill will grant a soul, not just melee. This encourages sitting at a distance and fishing for souls risk-free with Skull Servants instead of getting in and fighting.
//				- Make players drop timed soul pickups that the SB player needs to manually pick up to gain the soul. Upon being picked up, these souls immediately heal the user for 75 HP.
//					- This is a fairly drastic change. Only do this if people think SB is overpowered.
//					- Thanks to all of the work we just put into fake health kits, this should be super easy to implement!
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Orbital Sniper:
//			- There's not a lot of viable counterplay against an Orbital hugging the skybox, besides having another Orbital counter-snipe them.
//				- This will be solved with future characters who also have decent ranged choices.
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Count Heavnich:
//			- "Chow Down" might be too strong compared to "Share Sandvich", resulting in players never using Share.
//		////////////////////////////////////////////
//		- Demopan:
//			- Using Profit Blast to blast jump *might* give him too much mobility for a tank.
//
//	- MANDATORY TO-DO LIST (these MUST be done before the initial release):
//	- TODO: Rewrite the DoAbility system so that the forward can be used to prevent an ability from being activated
//	- TODO: Disable random crits on the beta test server (melee characters like Spookmaster and Demopan are utterly busted with random crits).
//	- TODO: Test all game modes (except for CTF which won't be officially supported):
//		- [X] Payload
//		- [ ] Payload Race
//		- [ ] Control Points
//		- [ ] King of the Hill
//	- TODO: Everything that happens on client disconnect (possibly already covered, not sure).
//	- TODO: Check includes to see if I will need to add anything to the prerequisites section of the readme before launch.
//	- TODO: Finalize the wiki by updating each page with all of the changes.
//	- TODO: Add support for translations. This will be a huge pain in the ass, but does not need to be done until public release.
//
//	- OPTIONAL TO-DO LIST (these do not need to be done for the initial release, but would be nice future additions):
//	- Separate the "description" section of "menu_display" into "desc_brief" and "desc_detailed".
//	- Make natives which share the names of FF2's natives and do the same things, so porting FF2 plugins is as simple as just changing the include file and recompiling.
//
//	- MINOR BUGS (bugs which have no impact on gameplay and just sort of look bad):
//	- For some reason, players get equipped with the heavy's Apparatchik's Apparel cosmetic????????????????????????? It's invisible while alive but becomes visible on death. This has no effect on gameplay but it's really ugly. Honestly baffling.
//	- Certain hats, when equipped via the wearable system, usually do not visually appear on bots (but they do work *sometimes*). Count Heavnich's "Noble Amassment of Hats" is an example of such a hat. 
//	- COUNT HEAVNICH: I don't know how, but "Chow Down" *sometimes* still causes you to T-pose when it ends. This is fixed immediately by switching weapons, and has no permanent side effects. It does look very unprofessional, though, so I am inclined to find a fix if possible.
//	- DEMOPAN: Becoming übercharged on BLU team causes your cosmetics to use the RED team's über texture.
//
//	- MAJOR BUGS (bugs which impact gameplay or character creation in any significant way):
//	- DEVELOPMENT: The "preserve" variable of cf_generic_wearable does not work. This may actually not be possible without an enormous workaround due to interference from TF2's source code, I am not sure.
//			- Scrap this feature entirely and remove all mentions of it from the code. This will be a giant pain in the ass but does not need to be done until public release.
//	- DEVELOPMENT: I don't know what I did, but suddenly friendly projectiles cannot pass through medigun shields. What the fuck.
//			- Once this is fixed, medigun shields will FINALLY be done.
//	- GAMEPLAY: The game is having that issue again where it becomes EXTREMELY laggy as soon as the round starts.
//			- Current Theory: None. There's not a memory leak, so it can't be that, and all of my other theories are disproven by the fact that the game runs fine in the pre-round.
//			- Maybe try temporarily turning the soundhook off to see if that fixes it?
//			- I don't see anything in the code that should be causing this lag. The lag might just be because my PC is not a dedicated server, so the server isn't getting enough resources to run well?
//
//	- PRESUMED UNFIXABLE (major bugs which I don't believe can be fixed with my current SourceMod expertise. The best thing you can do is classify these as exploits and punish them as such):
//		- DEMOPAN: Enemies can get stuck in his shield if they walk into it while it is held. Sadly, the only known way to fix this results in the shield becoming completely useless while held, and doesn't even solve the problem because you can still get players stuck by releasing the shield at just the right moment.
